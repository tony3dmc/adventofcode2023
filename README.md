Back to python to brush up. Making conscious effort to not use AI, since it removes the fun from the game - Copilot disabled and only using general python references.

> Spoiler warning in the following daily commentaries

## Day 1
Started easy, just removing all the non-digits from the string and taking the first and last. The second part was evil, it took me far too long to realise the overlapping nature of things like twone and eightwo and why string replacement wouldn't work, so I ended up scanning back and forth for matches instead, which ended up a little clumsy. I think this difficult start was a deliberate anti-AI effort, since figuring out the answer required some proper thinking.

## Day 2
Back in the game, two very simple parts achievable with easy loops and string processing. Easy peasy, those elves have big hands.
